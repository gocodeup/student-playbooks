# Student Playbook
### What This Is
This is a guide for expectations, a resource for advice on general Codeup life

### What This Is Not
This is *not* definitive. It may be updated, but the general ideas will be the same.

## General Expectations
While at Codeup, you'll be challenged on a nearly daily basis. It is expected that if you have a question, you raise your hand and ask, or red-cup your status. It can be difficult for staff to know who needs help when a student is sitting at their laptop, staring blankly at the screen, afraid to ask a question for this reason or that. 

It is expected that you will help yourself by using the resources provided to you while here at Codeup. 

Those resources include, but are obviously not limited to:
* Instructor help
* Student Fellow help
* Google
* StackOverflow
* Geekdom, after-hours (or before)
* Marker boards and markers (useful for drawing out hard-to-grasp concepts)
* Study-halls, led by Zach or led by Jonathan

**All of Codeup Staff wants you to succeed while you're here, and afterwards! We encourage you to be open, up-front about where you're at and to use the power of your hand to summon the knowledge base that we have to share with you.**

That being said, it is expected that *before* you ask for help, you will follow these steps to solving a problem:
* Take a deep breath, to calm your mind for a minute
* Take a step back from the problem, and think about what it is, in plain english, that you're trying to accomplish
* Break down the problem into several small, bite-size pieces.
* Think about the technology that you know about already, that will help you to accomplish the goal
* If you have thought about that, and still don't know, time to Google!
* Read up on StackOverflow, and Google. Try to solve.
* If, at *that* point, you haven't been able to solve it, raise your hand! Instructors and Fellows will come to your aid and help you solve the problem, to the best of their ability.

## General Behavior
### Stay Motivated!
So, it's day one, you're excited for Codeup, and ready to jump into the code! You're a hard worker, problem-solving machine that just cannot be stopped! *But*, when that feeling has passed, and you're used to the environment, you get comfortable, you begin to slack off and ease into a pattern of habits that will not help you succeed. 

Don't be this person! Keep the same fire throughout the course that you have on day one! Study hard, work harder, and be the best you that you can be, while you're here! If you do that, you will *unconditionally* succeed.

### Stay Calm!
Learning is an emotional process, though people don't think it is. Think about this! You want to learn to code, and you want to be the very best, like no one ever was. But somehow, you've been stumped! What do you do? You begin having doubts, beating yourself up because 'you should know this', etc. You see? Learning is an emotional thing! It can be easy to get upset with ourselves, or even blame our lack of understanding on any multitude of things. But we always think better with a clear, and calm head. If you feel yourself getting upset, or even just drawing a blank, step away from your computer! It is okay to do that! It's been proven that for productivity's sake, sometimes the most productive thing to do is to do nothing for a few minutes. 

Keep calm, and code on! If we get frustrated, we end up in a downward spiral of frustration, sadness, or even anger, that will do nothing for actually solving a problem. So for your success's sake, breathe! Plenty of people have felt how you feel and have sat where you're sitting. At Codeup, we deal with technology. Technology that is dealing with cold, thoughtless computers. They are dumb, and they do nothing until we tell them to. Just remember that you're in control. 

### Stay Healthy!
Due to the nature of coding, we sit for hours-on-end, staring at a screen. Because learning can be an emotional process, we can tend to over-eat on top of that! So we have to remember that though our mental health is important, our physical health is just as important. Get up, stretch, walk around, go to Travis Park for a minute to get some sunshine, whatever you have to do to stay away from the dreaded 'coders hunch'!

### Stay Friendly!
At Codeup, we're all here to learn, and we all have to do our part to keep the environment a fun one! So please treat your fellow coders and the staff with the respect that all of us deserve. Bad-mouthing or disrespect is not constructive, nor productive. Please speak up if you hear this from your fellow students, because that is not the face that we want to present here. This is a safe, fun and engaging environment and it goes against Codeup principles, and basic human principles, to treat others with disrespect. So please, stay friendly! :D
